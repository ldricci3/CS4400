# Our Instructions:

To run the application, create a MySQL user under MySQL Workbench Administration with username "username" and password "password" and give them DB Admin role on the next pane (bad practice but this is all local). If you do not do this, you will need to replace the parameters in lines 13 and 14 of server.js and figure out how to prevent overwriting it in the repo while also merging changes as they come in.

# Running the API/Backend Server:

Do this before npm start!! Open a terminal window in the phase4 directory and run "node server.js". You should get feedback in the log stating if it was able to connect to MySQL and what the hosting address and port is. After this you can run npm start as usual to startup and host the frontend. You will need to leave this open. To stop the server, use ctrl+C.

# React:
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the phase4 directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Work Distribution

Throughout the project, the team has tried to split our workloads as evenly as possible. During Phase 1 and Phase 2, we spent time in virtual meetings working together and discussing the database design. During Phases 3 and 4, we split the queries and screens evenly between the group members. We all attempted to create our pages and fit them into the application, and whenever one of us ran into any issues with our pages, the group as a whole did a great job helping each other out. \
Special shoutout to Andrew Johnston for getting our Express server up and working so we could connect to our MySQL database. Other than that one unique task, the actual implementation of the web application was distributed relatively evenly between the whole group.
